# ARIMA-Forecasting

In this project, I will explore the theory and application of ARIMA forecasting by applying it to three 
Economic Indicators: GDP, CPI and Unemployment. I will use Python to carry out the forecasting, 
produce my visualisations and generate summary tables. I will then compile my results, discussion
and analysis using Latex. All economic data is gathered using the FRED API.
